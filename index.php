       All Booked is a family owned bookstore that has something for everyone. Like many other things, it started off as an idea. August Roberts, the founder, got the idea for the business in collage and by the 1980s it was founded and gained instant local popularity. Since the birth of All Booked, it has made somewhat of a name for itself since it seems to be unlike other libraries.

      August wished for everyone and anyone to feel involved and comfortable in the store. He hosted trivia and other games every Thursday night in the store. These activities quickly gained popularity much like the store itself and Thursday game night quickly became an almost every night thing. These activities are announced every Sunday at noon and usually last 6-8 pm after the store closes. It is how the family keeps August's vision alive.

      His idea for including everyone has also added several different products to the store. Currently in the store the products range from music cds and records, to board games and video games, to movies. 75% of All Booked products are donations from customers themselves. This is why our prices are so affordable compared to the big named bookstores out there. The Roberts family has worked with each other and customers to keep August's dream alive. You can find his picture and read a more indepth story of his life story in the store.
